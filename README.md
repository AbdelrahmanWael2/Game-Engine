# Game-Engine
Board Drawing Engine using JavaScript and Scala, Logic Game Solvers using Prolog 

#Scala
In out scala project, we made use of the feautures provided by functional programming,
This is found in Higher-order functions & Pattern matching.
Higher-order function such as in Game Class where a function is passed to Game and takes arugment of type
GameState and returns a boolean. This is helpful as it provides abstraction and modularity in the code.
An example of pattern matching is the Case class of Symbol in TicTacToe, where Symbol is a subtype of Drawable class.
This is benificial for matching objects for diffrent types of datastructures.
