# Game-Engine
Board Drawing Engine using JavaScript and Scala, Logic Game Solvers using Prolog 
## Features

* Functional programming: Our Scala project makes use of the features provided by functional programming, such as higher-order functions and pattern matching.
* Higher-order functions: For example, in our Game class, we pass a function that takes an argument of type GameState and returns a boolean. This provides abstraction and modularity in the code.
* Pattern matching: We also make use of pattern matching in our TicTacToe game, where the Symbol case class is a subtype of the Drawable class. This is beneficial for matching objects for different types of data structures.
